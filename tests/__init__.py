# gesture_control_app/tests/__init__.py
# This file makes the 'tests' directory a Python package.
# It's typically left empty for test directories, but can be used for test-wide setup/teardown
# or to define test suites if using unittest. No direct imports are usually needed here
# unless you are creating a very specific test harness.
